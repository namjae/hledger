An example of tracking shared household expenses and also a shared asset (bank account),
from https://forum.plaintextaccounting.org/t/shared-expenses-with-shared-assets/242/4

> if I really wanted both my and household transactions in one journal, I might do:

me+household.journal

> Or, I'd go the extra step and split the files:

me.journal
household.journal

> Or, if I needed easier reports from household's point of view, I could record expenses:

me.journal
household2.journal
