balancesheetequity

(bse)

This command displays a balance sheet, showing historical ending
balances of asset, liability and equity accounts. Amounts are shown with
normal positive sign, as in conventional financial statements.

_FLAGS

This report shows accounts declared with the Asset, Cash, Liability or
Equity type (see account types). Or if no such accounts are declared, it
shows top-level accounts named asset, liability or equity (case
insensitive, plurals allowed) and their subaccounts.

Example:

$ hledger balancesheetequity
Balance Sheet With Equity 2008-12-31

                    || 2008-12-31 
====================++============

This command is a higher-level variant of the balance command, and
supports many of that command's features, such as multi-period reports.
It is similar to hledger balance -H assets liabilities equity, but with
smarter account detection, and liabilities/equity displayed with their
sign flipped.

This report is the easiest way to see if the accounting equation (A+L+E
= 0) is satisfied (after you have done a close --retain to merge
revenues and expenses with equity, and perhaps added --infer-equity to
balance your commodity conversions).

This command also supports the output destination and output format
options The output formats supported are txt, csv, tsv, html, and json.
